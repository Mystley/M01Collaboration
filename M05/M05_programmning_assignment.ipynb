The nose2 of the tutorial ran 2 test, mine ran 5 because it checked the \"test cases inheriting from unittest.TestCase in your current directory\"(Real Python).\n",

It would minimize the chances of errors to have someone else review the expected results so we are sure that when the code is behaving the right way that we are not the ones misinterprating it. And familiarizing myself with the assert method in unittest and not so a big deal after all.\n",
